***************************  What is Spring  ************************

(1). It is java based open source framework which support comprehensive infrastructure support. It is collection of module like spring mvc , spring boot , spring security , spring JDBC , spring AOP Spring ORM , Spring Test

(2). It reduce development time of an application. in erarly days of java web development we needed to write a lot of boilerplate code to insert a record into a data source. But by using the JDBCTemplate of the " Spring JDBC " module we can reduce it to a few lines of code with only a few configuartaions.

(3). Spring support both web.xml and servlet 3+ method to bootstrap the application.

 	Method (1) :- (web.xml approach)

 				  1.1 Servlet Container (the Server) reads web.xml.
 				  1.2 The DispatcherServlet defined in the web.xml is instantiated by the container.
 				  1.3 DispatcherServlet creates WebApplicationContext by reading WEB-INF/{ServletName}-servlet.xml.
 				  1.4 Finally the DispatcherServlet registers the beans defined in application context.

 	Method (2) :- {Servlet 3+ approach}

 				  1.1 Servlet Container (the Server) searches for classes implementing ServletContainerInitialilzer and executes.
 				  1.2 ServeletContaierInitializer finds all classes implementing WebApplicationInitializer.
 				  1.3 The WebApplicationInitializer creates the context with XML or @Configuration classes
 				  1.4 The WebApplicationInitializer creates the DispatcherServlet with the previously created context


***************************  What is Spring Boot  ************************

(1). Spring Boot is an extension of Spring Framework which eliminated the boilerplate Configuration (Maven Config , Server Establishment , JDBC Connection and other configuration like logging) for setting up a Spring Application. 

(2). Spring Boot Bootstraping

	 2.1 Entry point of a Spring Boot application is the class which is annotated with @SpringBootApplication.
	 2.2 Spring Boot uses public static void main entry-point to launch an embedded web server.
	 2.3 Spring Boot takes care of the binding of the Servlet , Filter and ServletContextInitializer beans from the application context to the embedded servlet 	container

(3). In a war project, JSP pages are served from src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/.

(4). In a Jar project, JSP pages cannot simply be served from webapp location or from src/main/resources/. That's because of the limitation stated in boot ref 		 docs

Features/Advanteages : 

(1). It reduces lots of development time and increases productivity

(2). It avoids writing lots of boilerplate Code, Annotations and XML Configuration.

(3). It is very easy to integrate Spring Boot Application with its Spring Ecosystem like Spring JDBC, Spring ORM, Spring Data, Spring Security etc

(4). It follows “Opinionated Defaults Configuration” Approach to reduce Developer effort

(5). It provides Embedded HTTP servers like Tomcat, Jetty etc

(6). It provides CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to develop and test Spring Boot(Java or Groovy) Applications from command prompt very easily and quickly.


Limitations/Drawback of Spring Boot : 

(1). It is some what bit time consuming process to convert existing or legacy Spring Framework projects into Spring Boot Applications but we can convert all 		 kinds of projects into Spring Boot Applications.

(2). To Start Opinionated Approach to create Spring Boot Applications, The Spring Team (The Pivotal Team) has provided the following three approaches.

		(2.1) Using Spring Boot CLI Tool
		(2.2) Using Spring STS IDE
		(2.3) Using Spring Initializr Website


Spring ecosystem, including work in the areas of cloud computing, big data, schema-less data persistence, reactive programming, and client-side application development.

Spring 2.5 introduced annotation Based component scanning Configuration which eliminated xml based config

Spring 3.0 introduced java based Configuration

 * Why Need of Spring Boot ? 

   (1). XML Configuration in Spring that was cumbersome task.
   (2)  Transaction Management , servlet , filters (Spring's DispatcherServlet) required explicit config in web.xml
   (3)  In Project dependency management where decididing what libaries need to be part of the project and which version will play well with others

 * 4 Core Tricks that perform by Spring Boot

 	(1). Auto Configuration
 	(2). Starter Dependencies
 	(3). Command Line Interface
 	(4). The Actuator
