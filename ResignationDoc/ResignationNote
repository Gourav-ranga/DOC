I am writing to provide you with my formal notice of resignation from The Company. My last day with the company will be July 29th 2020.

I appreciate the opportunities for professional development that you have provided me over the past one year. I have enjoyed my tenure at AnandRathi IT Pvt.

I would like to do anything i can to help with the transition, including wrapping up my responsibilities and training other team members. If i can be of any other assistance during this time. please let me know.

Thank you again for the opportunity to work at AnandRathi IT Pvt. Ltd. I wish you all the best as the company continues to grow and look forward to staying in touch.
